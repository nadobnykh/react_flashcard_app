## Copilot Coding Agent Basics

### What is the Copilot Coding Agent?  
The Copilot Coding Agent is an AI-powered assistant that autonomously manages software development tasks by working on assigned GitHub issues and creating pull requests.  
---

### How does the Copilot Coding Agent get started on a task?  
It monitors GitHub issues assigned to it, then creates a branch and starts coding to address the issue.  
---

### What role do pull requests play in the Copilot Coding Agent workflow?  
Pull requests are used by the agent to submit its completed work for review and integration into the main codebase.  
---

### Can developers review and modify the agent’s pull requests?  
Yes, developers can review, comment on, and modify pull requests created by the agent before merging.  
---

### Does the Copilot Coding Agent run tests automatically?  
Yes, the agent can run tests to validate its changes before creating pull requests.  
---

### What programming languages does the Copilot Coding Agent support?  
It supports multiple languages, especially those popular on GitHub like JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, and more.  
---

### Is human oversight necessary when using the Copilot Coding Agent?  
Human oversight is recommended to ensure code quality and alignment with project goals.  
---

## GitHub Issues and Branching

### What is a GitHub issue?  
A GitHub issue is a way to track tasks, bugs, feature requests, or enhancements in a project’s repository.  
---

### How does branching help in software development?  
Branching allows developers to work on new features or bug fixes separately from the main codebase, enabling safe experimentation and parallel development.  
---

### How does the Copilot Coding Agent use branches?  
It creates dedicated branches for each issue it works on to isolate changes.  
---

### What is the significance of pull requests in GitHub?  
Pull requests propose changes from one branch to be merged into another, allowing discussion and code review before integration.  
---

### Can pull requests trigger automated workflows?  
Yes, pull requests can trigger CI/CD pipelines, tests, and other automation configured in GitHub Actions or other services.  
---

## AI Coding Assistants Overview

### What are AI coding assistants?  
AI coding assistants use artificial intelligence to help write, complete, or review code more efficiently.  
---

### How does Copilot differ from Copilot Coding Agent?  
Copilot suggests code snippets and completions interactively, while the Copilot Coding Agent autonomously completes whole issues and creates pull requests.  
---

### What benefits do AI coding assistants provide?  
They speed up coding, reduce errors, provide suggestions, and help with learning new APIs or frameworks.  
---

### Are AI coding assistants capable of writing bug-free code?  
No AI can guarantee bug-free code, so human review and testing remain essential.  
---

### Can AI coding assistants work with multiple programming languages?  
Yes, many support a broad range of languages and frameworks.  
---

## Pull Requests and Code Review

### What is the purpose of a code review?  
To ensure code quality, maintainability, and adherence to project standards by having peers examine changes.  
---

### How can pull requests facilitate collaboration?  
They provide a platform for discussion, feedback, and incremental improvement before merging code.  
---

### What is a merge conflict?  
A merge conflict occurs when changes in different branches overlap and cannot be automatically reconciled.  
---

### How should merge conflicts be resolved?  
By manually reviewing conflicting changes and deciding the correct code to keep.  
---

### Can automated tests run as part of pull requests?  
Yes, tests can automatically run on the code in a pull request to catch errors early.  
---

## Software Development Best Practices

### Why is writing tests important?  
Tests help catch bugs early, ensure code correctness, and make refactoring safer.  
---

### What is continuous integration (CI)?  
CI is a practice of automatically building and testing code changes frequently to detect issues quickly.  
---

### How does continuous deployment (CD) differ from CI?  
CD extends CI by automatically deploying code changes to production after passing tests.  
---

### What is code documentation and why is it important?  
Documentation explains code functionality, usage, and design decisions to help current and future developers.  
---

### Why is modular code beneficial?  
Modular code is easier to understand, test, maintain, and reuse.  
---

## GitHub Actions and Automation

### What are GitHub Actions?  
GitHub Actions are workflows that automate tasks such as building, testing, and deploying code.  
---

### How can GitHub Actions improve the development process?  
They provide automation that saves time, reduces manual errors, and enforces consistent workflows.  
---

### Can the Copilot Coding Agent trigger GitHub Actions?  
Yes, its pull requests can trigger workflows like automated testing or deployment.  
---

### What is a workflow in GitHub Actions?  
A workflow is a defined automated process triggered by events like pull requests or commits.  
---

### What is a runner in GitHub Actions?  
A runner is a server that executes the steps defined in a GitHub Actions workflow.  
---

## General Software Development Concepts

### What is version control?  
Version control is the management of changes to source code over time, allowing tracking and collaboration.  
---

### Why use Git for version control?  
Git is a distributed, fast, and widely used version control system that supports branching and merging effectively.  
---

### What is a commit in Git?  
A commit records a snapshot of changes in the repository history.  
---

### What does "forking" a repository mean?  
Forking creates a personal copy of someone else’s repository to freely experiment and make changes.  
---

### What is the difference between a fork and a branch?  
A fork is a separate copy of a repository, while a branch is a parallel line of development within the same repository.  
---

## AI Ethics and Limitations

### What ethical considerations exist when using AI coding assistants?  
Concerns include bias, code quality, licensing, and accountability for generated code.  
---

### Can AI assistants inadvertently introduce security vulnerabilities?  
Yes, AI-generated code might not follow best security practices without careful review.  
---

### Why is transparency important in AI coding tools?  
Users should understand how code suggestions are generated and the limitations involved.  
---

### Should developers fully trust AI-generated code?  
No, developers should always review and test AI-generated code thoroughly.  
---

### What is the importance of training data for AI assistants?  
Training data quality and diversity directly affect the relevance and safety of AI-generated code.
